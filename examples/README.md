# Examples

The top-level organization of this examples repository is divided into
**quickstarts** and **expositions**.

Quickstarts contain the simple examples for critical workflows to build,
evaluate and track your LLM app. These examples are displayed in the
TruLens documentation under the "Getting Started" section.

This expositional library of TruLens examples is organized by the component of
interest. Components include `/models`, `/frameworks` and `/vector-dbs`.
Use cases are also included under `/use_cases`. These examples can be found
in TruLens documentation as the TruLens cookbook.
